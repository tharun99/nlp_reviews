another useless recycling of a brutal mid  s american sports movie

downright transparent is the script s endless assault of embarrassingly hamfisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a  cooler  pg rating 

significantly less charming than listening to a fouryearold

is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary

should be punishable by chainsaw

s as sorry a mess as its director s diabolical debut  mad cows 

is surely one of the most frantic  virulent and foulnatured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio 

pointless  tasteless and idiotic

it s hard to say who might enjoy this

there s apparently nothing left to work with  sort of like michael jackson s nose 

hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is

get paid enough to sit through crap like this

humorless soap opera

of very bad scouse accents

suffers because it does nt have enough vices to merit its minute length
