a failure of storytelling

celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs 

dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick

a glorified sitcom  and a long  unfunny one at that

the acting is amateurish  the cinematography is atrocious 

go down with a ship as leaky

a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome

poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines

find it uninteresting

tell you how tedious  how resolutely unamusing  how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is  and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents

there s not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy 

he needs to pull his head out of his butt

needlessly poor quality

one of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced 

know why steven seagal is considered a star  nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good

to losing my lunch

potentially trite and overused

mindnumbingly  indescribably bad

an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people  manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy 

that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it

it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachykeen and so tubthumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it

comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter 

scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres

only twofifths of a satisfying movie experience

its story just is nt worth telling

but it s a rushed  slapdash  sequelforthesake  ofasequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity

a bad movie that

me say the obvious  abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here

that stealing harvard is a horrible movie  if only it were that grand a failure

it s wasted yours

violent  vulgar and forgettably

forgets to make it entertaining

with jump cuts  fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics  yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is 

when green threw medical equipment at a window  not because it was particularly funny  but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle s walker and toss it at the screen in frustration

dialogue   seconds of plot

the most pitiful directing

depraved  incoherent  instantly disposable

mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film  which is often preachy and poorly acted 

worthless  from its pseudorockvideo opening to the idiocy of its last frames 

an unbelievably stupid film
