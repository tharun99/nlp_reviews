bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre

crass  contrived sequels

as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film s shooting schedule waiting to scream   got aids yet

is so prolonged and boring it is nt even close to being the barnburningly bad movie it promised it would be

a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work

the secrets of time travel will have been discovered  indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again 

guy gets girl  guy loses girl  audience falls asleep 

uneven performances and a spotty script

matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise

what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles  book does not translate well to the screen 

a superfluous sequel

it s a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime

far less endearing disabilities

could be a single iota worse  a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage

it s not scary in the slightest 

left an acrid test in this gourmet s mouth

disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product s unshapely look

directed the film from the back of a taxicab

ugly and destructive

in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness

might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener

induces headaches

ransacks its archives for a quickbuck sequel 

stiff or just plain bad

instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull

much worse than bland

other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low

both shallow and dimwitted

brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch

there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low

lrb but rrb there is nt much about k that s unique or memorable 

was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in

windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent twohourandfifteenminute length 

has less spice than a rat burger

spy kids  looks as if it were made by a highly gifted yearold instead of a grown man 

some unpaid intern had just typed  chris rock    anthony hopkins  and  terrorists  into some univaclike script machine

a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities 

it ll probably be in video stores by christmas 

the incessant use

is one big  dumb action movie
