tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy  or  worse yet  nonexistent  ideas

be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace

more dutiful than enchanting  terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating

begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain

julia roberts hands out awards  with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism

is so bleak that it s hardly watchable

this remake of lina wertmuller s  eroticomedy might just be the biggest husbandandwife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero

remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops

fails as a dystopian movie  as a retooling of fahrenheit   and even as a ripoff of the matrix 

bad  bad movie

beneath the uncanny  inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of moviebiz farce  lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments 

like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing

is painfully formulaic and stilted

can be forgiven for realizing that you ve spent the past  minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already

it s all surface psychodramatics 

walked out muttering words like  horrible  and  terrible  

a sour little movie at its core  an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety

no charm  no laughs  no fun

made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept

limps along on a squirminducing fishoutofwater formula that goes nowhere and goes there very  very slowly

has about th the fun of its spry  predecessor  but it s a rushed  slapdash  sequelforthesake  ofasequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity

full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are nt looking for them

it should pay reparations to viewers 

how bad his movie is

we never feel anything for these characters

even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable  shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture 

have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow

runs out of steam after a half hour 

by halfbaked setups and sluggish pacing

an unfunny movie

is hugely overwritten

consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire

s still terrible 

of narrative banality

the worst films of the summer

a complete waste

introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix

strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook 

does nt add up to a whole lot

s in the action scenes that things fall apart
