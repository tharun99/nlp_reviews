appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept

of the same old garbage

wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy

of  let s get this thing over with

derrida is all but useless

pretend like your sat scores are below  and

s pauly shore awful

a beyondlame satire

spend   on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby

really bad imitation

greatest mistake

like a bad improvisation exercise  the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives  loves and the art they re struggling to create 

rotten in almost every single facet of production that you ll want to crawl up your own  in embarrassment 

is ultimately scuttled by a plot that s just too boring and obvious

wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie

trying to make head or tail of the story in the hiphop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain  and the payoff is negligible

sure which will take longer to heal  the welt on johnny knoxville s stomach from a riotcontrol projectile or my own tortured psyche

is a disaster of a story  full of holes and completely lacking in chills 

starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywoodaction cliches 

atrociously  mindnumbingly  indescribably bad movie

put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender   and  minutes of unrecoverable life

feels more like a rejected xfiles episode than a credible account of a puzzling reallife happening 

except maybe for the last  minutes  which are as maudlin as any afterschool special you can imagine

fails to overcome the film s manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes 

is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot  

collateral damage is trash 

to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers

do nt need to know your icet s from your coolj s to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned  something is rotten in the state of california

is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine

as stiff  ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus

deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie

entirely stale concept

a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse 

one baaaaaaaaad movie

about as original as a gangster sweating

as plain and pedestrian as catsup 

after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course 

a meanspirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia

so horrendously confusing

amid the deliberate  tiresome ugliness
