to sit through than most of jaglom s selfconscious and gratingly irritating films

artsy and often pointless

the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire

no one involved  save dash  shows the slightest aptitude for acting  and the script  credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest  tron  anderson  seems entirely improvised 

thumbs friggin  down

bad  is the operative word for  bad company

bean drops the ball too many times 

an erotic thriller that s neither too erotic nor very thrilling  either 

i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops

s difficult to imagine that a more confused  less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 

she needs to shake up the mix  and work in something that does nt feel like a halfbaked standup routine

this minute dud

this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful  no doubt  it s the worst movie i ve seen this summer

is the script s endless assault of embarrassingly hamfisted sex jokes

will be from unintentional giggles  several of them 

rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again

a long  dull procession of despair

s not nearly enough that s right

way to make jk rowling s marvelous series into a deadly bore

living far too much in its own head

pitiful  slapdash disaster 

see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from  promising  to  interesting  to  familiar  before landing squarely on  stupid 

you wish had been developed with more care

the really bad blair witch project

with this silly little puddle of a movie

bad mannered  ugly and destructive little 

an amateurish  quasiimprovised acting exercise

if this is cinema  i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey 

you never want to see another car chase  explosion or gunfight again

sloppy  madeformovie

ca nt rescue adrian lyne s unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing 

but if the essence of magic is its makebelieve promise of life that soars above the material realm  this is the opposite of a truly magical movie 

it all unfolds predictably  and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time  providing no real sense of suspense 

offers the nonetoooriginal premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar

because they re clueless and inept

thoughtless  random  superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents

very depressing movie

an appalling  ace ventura  ripoff that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak  former wrestler chyna and dolly parton 

explosions  sadism and seeing people

that has no point and goes nowhere
