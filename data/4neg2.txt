flimsy  or  worse yet  nonexistent  ideas

smug selfsatisfaction

bogged down in earnest dramaturgy

s a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character  especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix s 

that s barely shocking  barely interesting and most of all  barely anything

for most movies   minutes is short  but this one feels like a life sentence

lowbrow humor  gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard

you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain 

that it s inauthentic at its core and that its story just is nt worth telling

why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie

is definitely meaningless  vapid and devoid

the answer is clear  not easily and  in the end  not well enough 

nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a looselyconnected string of actingworkshop exercises 

a recycled and dumbeddown version of love story

the long  dishonorable history

hindered by a central plot that s peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about

a huge disappointment coming

pity anyone who sees this mishmash 

ca nt begin to tell you how tedious  how resolutely unamusing  how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is  and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents 

feel more like a nonstop cry for attention  than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment

is almost entirely witless and inane  carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh 

unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction

are less than adorable

been recycled more times than i d care to count

sabotaged by pomposity

this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself   ah  yes  here we have a bad  bad  bad movie

and it s not that funny  which is just generally insulting 

so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines

resolutely unamusing  how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is

they wo nt enjoy the movie at all 

 punitive minutes

interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience

poorly written  murky and weakly acted  the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo 

the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project

keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good

pass this stinker off

contrived  nonsensical and formulaic

lazy  miserable and smug 

it would be easy for critics to shred it

which is paperthin and decidedly unoriginal
