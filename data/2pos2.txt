a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception  which  while it may not rival the filmmaker s period pieces  is still very much worth seeing 

full of privileged moments and memorable performances

engages us in constant fits of laughter  until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story  and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched

astonish and entertain

commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals

frailty  offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight  telling creepy stories to give each other the willies 

are stanzas of breathtaking  aweinspiring visual poetry 

a terrific performance

a good music documentary 

glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat

flatout amusing 

infidelity drama is nicely shot  welledited and features a standout performance by diane lane 

call reno a great film

it s a lyrical endeavour 

for most of its footage  the new thriller proves that director m night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp  shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo 

builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion  sacrifice  and christian love

handed down from the movie gods

about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl

consistently clever and suspenseful 

masterpiece  and  triumph  and

memorable cinematic experience

interesting movie

have nt laughed that hard in years

in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago

a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet 

a majestic achievement  an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth

far more entertaining than i had expected

gorgeously strange movie

director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film s music than to the story line  what s best about drumline is its energy 

a surprising winner

from the pitchperfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy  like mike shoots and scores  doing its namesake proud

a solidly constructed  entertaining thriller

into one of the summer s most pleasurable movies

impeccable comic timing  raffish charm and piercing intellect

good performances and

have viewers guessing just who s being conned right up to the finale

emotionally satisfying

a very entertaining  thoughtprovoking film

feelgood family comedy

a satisfying evening at the multiplex
