a loud  brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy 

seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material 

having sucked dry the undead action flick formula  blade ii mutates into a grossout monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary 

a sad  soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads

just does nt have the necessary selfcontrol to guide a loose  poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy 

s simply stupid  irrelevant and deeply 

is nt that stealing harvard is a horrible movie  if only it were that grand a failure 

dressed as a children s party clown gets violently gangraped

all comedy is subversive  but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad

in this pretentious mess

a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothersstyle  downanddirty laugher for the female

the following things are not at all entertaining  the bad sound  the lack of climax and  worst of all  watching seinfeld lrb who is also one of the film s producers rrb do everything he can to look like a good guy

more to be prescribed than recommended  as visually bland as a dentist s waiting room  complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms 

the movie is rather choppy 

could nt find stardom if mapquest emailed him pointtopoint driving directions

imagine lrb if possible rrb a pasolini film without passion or politics  or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor  and you have some idea of the glum  numb experience of watching o fantasma 

would benigni s italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster

goes off the rails in its final  or  minutes

are rolling over in their graves

plodding picture

a movie more to be prescribed than recommended  as visually bland as a dentist s waiting room  complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms 

the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms spears

this movie  a certain scene in particular  brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch 

does nt offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is  or even its attitude toward its subject 

spirals downward  and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion 

the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids  children behave like adults and everyone

re never quite sure where selfpromotion ends and the truth begins

even though i could not stand them

the film is way too full of itself 

boredom to the point of collapse  turning into a black hole of dullness

a sentimental mess that never rings true

ultimately you ll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered

crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls 

this flat run at a hiphop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines 

it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic 

this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity 

her life is meaningless  vapid and devoid of substance  in a movie that is definitely meaningless  vapid and devoid of substance

bad  is the operative word for  bad company 

wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago

degenerates into hogwash
