committed dumbness

a phlegmatic bore 

it s possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel  but the result is more puzzling than unsettling 

in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history

unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald s  let alone some savvy street activism

too boring and obvious

is busy contriving false  sitcomworthy solutions to their problems

i have to put up with  minutes of it

a poky and pseudoserious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise 

i could feel my eyelids  getting  very  heavy 

a crummy  wannabehip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies  when you could just rent those movies instead  let alone seek out a respectable new one

never having seen the first two films in the series  i ca nt compare friday after next to them  but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days 

utterly incompetent

most of the problems with the film do nt derive from the screenplay  but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved

has nt developed characters so much as caricatures  onedimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else

i would go back and choose to skip it 

the young stars are too cute  the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative  the message is too blatant  the resolutions are too convenient

overthetop  and amateurish

loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity

it s been  months and  preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie  but

the point of ridiculousness

the new film is a subzero version of monsters  inc  without the latter s imagination  visual charm or texture 

s lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another

close to losing my lunch

the same tired old gags  modernized for the extreme sports generation 

is messy  murky  unsatisfying

pair that with really poor comedic writing  and you ve got a huge mess 

the most excruciating  minutes one

it does nt make for great cinema

to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indieheads

lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about  minutes past a child s interest and an adult s patience 

nair just does nt have the necessary selfcontrol to guide a loose  poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy 

there surrender   and  minutes of unrecoverable life

 blade ii  just does nt cut it

paid enough to sit through crap like this

will you feel after an minute ripoff of the rock with action confined to slomo gun firing and random glassshattering 

from the dullest science fiction

hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby

but this new jangle of noise  mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title 

a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory
