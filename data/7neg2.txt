the biggest problem with roger avary s uproar against the mpaa is that  even in all its director s cut glory  he s made a film that s barely shocking  barely interesting and most of all  barely anything 

the thing just never gets off the ground 

the dialogue is cumbersome  the simpering soundtrack and editing more so

this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year 

a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender   and  minutes of unrecoverable life 

electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness

a boring  pretentious muddle that uses a sensational  reallife thcentury crime as a metaphor for  well  i m not exactly sure what  and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop

cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory 

lowkey  minute infomercial

be prescribed than recommended  as visually bland as a dentist s waiting room  complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms

is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days

look smeary and blurry  to the point of distraction

proves tiresome  with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paperthin characterizations and facile situations

the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail

tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course

ludicrous and contrived plot

took three minutes of dialogue   seconds of plot and turned them into a minute movie that feels five hours long 

feels as if lrb there s rrb a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good  hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something 

acting that could be any flatter

few things more frustrating

is exactly what it wants to be  an atrociously  mindnumbingly  indescribably bad movie

to guide a loose  poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy

assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce  because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low

distasteful and downright creepy

have worn threadbare 

is rote spookiness  with nary an original idea lrb or role  or edit  or score  or anything  really rrb in sight

cinematic disaster

how to suffer  and if you see this film you ll know too

seem to be in a contest to see who can outbadact the other

the movie is busy contriving false  sitcomworthy solutions to their problems 

ll want to crawl up your own  in embarrassment

skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you re sure to get more out of the latter experience

severe body odor

to the cadence of a depressed fifteenyearold s suicidal poetry

is like being trapped at a bad rock concert

the only way to tolerate this insipid  brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers 

is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material

it s loud and boring  watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert

is a subzero version of monsters  inc  without the latter s imagination

an insultingly unbelievable final act
