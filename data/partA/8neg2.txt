long   dull procession despair  
s not nearly enough s right 
make j k  rowling s marvelous series deadly bore 
living far too much own head 
pitiful   slapdash disaster    
movie takes such speedy swan dive    promising     interesting     familiar  before landing squarely    stupid  
wish had been developed more care 
really bad blair witch project 
silly little puddle movie 
bad mannered   ugly destructive little           
amateurish   quasi improvised acting exercise
